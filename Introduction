This year I decided to do something a little different than normal for the Advent season. For the last several years, I participated in the "Advent of Code". Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

This year I am taking on Perl Object Oriented Programming and publishing my journey. When you teach something you learn the subject matter twice! You pick up things you never knew and so blogging and teaching are worthwhile!

The code will be added and downloadable from GitHub in the Resources section below.  All code was tested in Strawberry Perl 5.40 and should run on any version. 

What Are "Gang of Four" Design Patterns?

The Gang of Four (GoF) refers to the four authors (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides) of the influential 1994 book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," which describes 23 classic software design patterns.

These patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems in object-oriented programming. They're divided into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns, each serving a different purpose.

Design Patterns in Perl Context

Perl implements these patterns differently than traditional OO languages like C++ or Java because Perl has unique features that make some patterns simpler or even unnecessary.  The examples can be used as AI templates 
to rapidly select and prototype OOO approaches to individual design requirements and then use them as a base for translating into other languages as needed.

How Perl's Features Affect Patterns:

Many patterns can be implemented with code references (callbacks) in Perl - the Strategy and Template Method patterns can use code references, Builder builds structures with hash and array references, and Interpreters can use simple tools like split or Parse::RecDescent.
Languages without code references are missing an important type - Perl's code references allow implementing many patterns without creating multiple classes whose sole purpose is to provide one function.  I've taken Anwar's "Design Patterns in Modern Perl" as a sort of template to introduce each design with notes on usage.  

The 22 Gang of Four Patterns

Creational Patterns (Object Creation)

Factory Method - Creates objects without specifying exact class
Abstract Factory - Creates families of related objects
Singleton - Ensures only one instance exists
Prototype - Creates objects by cloning
Builder - Constructs complex objects step-by-step

Structural Patterns (Object Composition)

Adapter - Makes incompatible interfaces work together
Bridge - Separates abstraction from implementation
Composite - Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly
Decorator - Adds behavior dynamically
Facade - Provides simplified interface
Proxy - Controls access to another object

Behavioral Patterns (Object Interaction)

Chain of Responsibility - Passes requests along a chain
Command - Encapsulates requests as objects
Interpreter - Implements a language grammar
Iterator - Accesses elements sequentially
Mediator - Reduces coupling between objects
Memento - Captures and restores object state
Observer - Notifies dependents of state changes
State - Changes behavior when state changes
Strategy - Selects algorithm at runtime
Template Method - Defines algorithm skeleton
Visitor - Separates algorithms from object structure

Examples of GoF Patterns in Perl## Key Takeaways About GoF Patterns in Perl:

* Perl's flexibility simplifies many patterns - Code references replace entire class hierarchies
* Some patterns are built into Perl - Iterator (foreach), Singleton (BEGIN blocks), Decorator (pipes)
* Patterns are language-agnostic concepts - The principles apply, but implementation varies
* Don't over-engineer - Use patterns when they solve real problems, not just to use them
* The Gang of Four patterns remain valuable for understanding software design, but Perl's dynamic nature often provides simpler, more elegant implementations than the C++/Java examples in the original book!
