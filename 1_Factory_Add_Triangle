## Adding Triangle Shape shows how easy it is to add to the Factory example

**Step 1: Create the Triangle class (add anywhere with other shapes)**
```perl
package Shape::Triangle;
use Moo;
with qw/Shape/;
sub draw { 'Drawing a Triangle' }
```

**Step 2: Add to the dispatch table in ShapeFactory**
```perl
my %shape_map = (
    CIRCLE    => 'Shape::Circle',
    RECTANGLE => 'Shape::Rectangle',
    SQUARE    => 'Shape::Square',
    TRIANGLE  => 'Shape::Triangle',  # ← Just add this line!
);
```

## That's It!

Now you can use it:
```perl
my $triangle = $factory->getShape('TRIANGLE');
say $triangle->draw;  # Output: Drawing a Triangle
```

## Complete Example with TriangleDone! I've updated the artifact to include Triangle. 

## Why This Is So Easy

**The Factory Method pattern provides:**

✅ **Only 2 places to modify** - Add class, update dispatch table  
✅ **No client code changes** - All existing code still works  
✅ **No other shape classes affected** - Complete isolation  
✅ **Follows Open/Closed Principle** - Open for extension, closed for modification
